# 100% Halal Café in Haslingden

We get our **chicken sausage** meat from [Malik Butchers](https://www.malikbutchers.com/) - premium artisan halal butchers. Our sausage rolls are 89% meat - top quality scran.

Our **turkey rashers** come from [Saffron Alley](https://saffronalley.com/products/halal-smoked-turkey-rashers) - the best quality we've tasted.

For everyday items like **halal mini marshmallows, drinks, snacks and crisps**, we use [Khanjra](https://www.khanjra.co.uk/), just down the road in Blackburn.

## Freshly Prepared

Our **chicken tikka** is marinated fresh every other day using chicken breast from local halal butchers. After 24 hours marinating, it's oven baked to perfection. Our chicken tikka masala uses our own special recipe.

**Chapal kebabs** are our best seller - made with 10kg of chicken meat and our secret spice recipe, formed into medium burger-sized patties. They pair perfectly with our homemade mint chilli chutney. Shout out to the head chef at our soft play centre, [Monkey Playland](https://www.monkeyplayland.co.uk) for inventing them!

## Cooking Methods

We don't fry anything in our kitchen - everything is **oven baked** or prepared in our Merry Chef oven. That's the same type used in Costa Coffee - the best in the biz!

**We hope this explains that our customers can rest assured - we're a 100% halal cafe.**
