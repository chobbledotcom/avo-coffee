Many thanks to all the customers who have taken the time to leave a review.

> "When the food arrived (quickly, might I add), it was everything I hoped for and then some. The eggs? Cooked to perfection – the kind you’d see on a foodie's Instagram feed with captions like "Eggcellence!" They nailed it. Truly." [~Google](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i8MW9owNSyck8JqA6)

> "Really pleased to find this place! They have a good selection of vegan options - including a selection of vegan cakes! Plenty of room to sit in, or you can take away. Nice and clean, and friendly service." [~Happycow]({{ site.social.happycow }})

> "Great little cafe. Clean and friendly, but best of all a good selection of vegan food - which is hard to find round here. I had the wrap and a cake - which was brilliant!! Plenty of space to sit in - or they offer take away." [~Google](https://maps.app.goo.gl/orewasSPwtGJmsGj6)
