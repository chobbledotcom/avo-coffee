# 🥑 About Avo Coffee

> "Absolutely spot on, food is excellent, service is great and the coffee is 10/10 👌" [~Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Lunatixdub/posts/10162619753440350)

Tucked away in the heart of Haslingden, Rossendale, we're a proper family-run café. Everything's freshly prepared using high quality ingredients. Pop in next time you're in Haslingden - you'll find a warm welcome waiting!

## ☕ Our Story

We opened Avo Coffee with one thing in mind: creating a friendly spot where locals and visitors alike could enjoy a proper brew and tasty food. We wanted to give something back to our Haslingden community - a cozy place where everyone feels right at home.

## 🥞 Our Food

Our kitchen serves up honest, freshly-made food that'll put a smile on your face. We've got loads of vegan and gluten-free options too - proper tasty alternatives. Whether you fancy a full English to kick-start your morning, a light bite for lunch, or a sweet treat with a brew, we've got you covered.

## 🇬🇧 Shop Local

We're big believers in supporting our neighbours. Our eggs come fresh each week from just down the road at [Woodhill Farm](https://www.woodhill-farm.co.uk), and whenever we can, we grab our ingredients from local suppliers. It's better for the food, better for Haslingden, and just makes sense to us.

## 💚 What Our Customers Say

A massive thanks to everyone who's taken a moment to leave us a review - they mean the world to us.

> "When the food arrived (quickly, might I add), it was everything I hoped for and then some. The eggs? Cooked to perfection – the kind you’d see on a foodie's Instagram feed with captions like "Eggcellence!" They nailed it. Truly." [~Google](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i8MW9owNSyck8JqA6)

> "Really pleased to find this place! They have a good selection of vegan options - including a selection of vegan cakes! Plenty of room to sit in, or you can take away. Nice and clean, and friendly service." [~Happycow]({{ site.social.happycow }})

> "Great little cafe. Clean and friendly, but best of all a good selection of vegan food - which is hard to find round here. I had the wrap and a cake - which was brilliant!! Plenty of space to sit in - or they offer take away." [~Google](https://maps.app.goo.gl/orewasSPwtGJmsGj6)
